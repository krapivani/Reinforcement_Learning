# Reinforcement_Learning

This project combines deep learning and reinforcement learning, we have a agent and we have to teach our agent to navigate a grid-world environment, here our agent (Tom) has to find shortest path to goal (Jerry). We use Deep learning and Q-learning for this task. We give our agent reward if he goes closer to goal and punishment if he doesnot and over the time (number of episodes) our agent will learn the pattern since the position of goal is deterministic
